* Description
  The program has 5 options:
  1. Create a new process.
     1. Enter process' name;
     2. Enter process' burst time;
     3. Select ptocess' queue (priority or nonpriority);
     4. PIDs ($PID_{0..n}$) are autogenerated by incrementing;
  2. Mo process from its current queue
     to the tail of another or the current queue.
     1. Select process' PID;
     2. Select queue to move the process.
  3. Run next process.
     - Any process that is at the priority queue's head
       will be the first to be executed.
     - Any process exection has a time quantum of 10 burst time (BT).
       - If current running process P extrapolar 10bt while running,
         then P is preempted,
         and P is moved to the nonpriority queue's tail.
  4. Print process queues.
     - Print priority and nonpriority queues,
       as well processes priorities.
       - ~PID~: Process IDentification
       - ~PRI~: PRIority: current/remaining
       - ~PRI_O~: PRIority: Original
       - ~AT~: Arrival Time
       - ~BT~: Burst Time: current/remaining
       - ~BT_O~: Burst Time: Original
       - ~NAME~: Process' NAME
  5. Quit.
     - Terminate programs' process.
